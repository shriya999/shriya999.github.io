excerpt: <ul style="padding:0%;"><li>Developed a Spiking CNN for object recognition inspired by the neural mechanisms of primate visual systems, using gaussian filters modelling the receptive fields of a foveal pit. </li><li>This led to an optimized inference using only 10% of the original filtered coefficients, proving the potential for sparse and low-power computation.</li><li>Presented the paper based on this work at IJCNN'20.</li></ul>
