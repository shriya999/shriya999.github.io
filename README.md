# Source Code for Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website and the compiled website can be accessed publicly [here](https://shriya999.github.io). The code is based on [Jon Barron's academic website](https://jonbarron.info/) and the corresponding Jekyll version of the code is taken from [Leonid Keselman's repository](https://github.com/leonidk/new_website).
